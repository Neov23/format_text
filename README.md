# Format Text App

This program is a GUI. The user selects a text file or (all files from) a
directory, then selects the output folder and starts converting. The program
will read the input text file, create a new file in user's preferred directory
and in this new (output) file, it will store the text from the input file, but
formatted in a way, that every line ends at maximum 80 characters.

I started this project to expand my python skills and learn Tkinter a bit.

## Guide

This repo includes the python files with raw code, but also a "Format Text"
directory with an executable in it. If you want to easily use the program,
download the "Format Text" directory and read the "README.txt" that is stored
in it.
